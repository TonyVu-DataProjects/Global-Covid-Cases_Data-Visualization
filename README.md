## Overview
The aim of this project is to visualize the global covid cases dataset and uncover the insights regarding how cases in each country change overtime and what this information implies.  
This project is important to review how the virus spread across the world and which country were infected the most and at what pace. 

## Dataset
Provide details about the dataset(s) used in the project.
- **Source**: Conestoga college learning material.
- **Description**: The dataset contains data about covid cases for all countries. Key features include total cases, new cases, total death, new deaths. 
- **Preprocessing**: The data has been cleaned and ready for visualizations.

## Installation
Instructions for setting up the project locally. 

### Prerequisites
List any software, libraries, or tools required to run the project.
- [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop)

### Setup
Steps to install the necessary packages and set up the environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TonyVu-DataProjects/Global-Covid-Cases_Data-Visualization.git

or download zip file

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Global-Covid-Cases_Data-Visualization

# Access Dashboards locally
Install Tableau Desktop > Double click "Covid_Activity_Dashboards.twbx" file
```
## Methodology
- Charts used: 
1. Horizontal bar chart: used for ranking and comparing between countries.
2. Choropleth map / Geographical map: used for geographical visualizing with data value demonstrated by color and bubble size dimensions.  
3. Text table: used for displaying metrics.
4. Time-series plot: used for displaying trends of cases overtime for each country.

## Visualizations

## Conclusions
**Insights from visualizations:**
1. United States has the highest number of covid cases followed by India and Brazil. These three countries are among biggest population countries. 
2. Islands or small land like Micronesia, Vanuatu, or Marshall Islands have very few cases, potentially by their isolated nature. 
 3. Most countries have their biggest spike in daily new cases between November 2020 and January 2021 except India which had the biggest spike between April 2021 and May 2021.

## Future Work
- Enhancements: 
1. Includes data from other data sources (e.g: Country standard of living & healthcare level)
2. Includes correlated charting to visualize the correlation between spreading pace and country living ranks. 

- Further Analysis:
1. Did more healthcare advanced countries have slower spread and lower percentage of cases to population?
2. Did countries with high density have faster spread than countries with lower density?
